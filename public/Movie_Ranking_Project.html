<h1>Adam's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3:</h2>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
    I recently saw this movie in the theater. I wish I was able to see it in the 70mm IMAX screening 
but the closest one to me was four hours away. Nevertheless, it was a great movie I actually
plan on seeing again. What I loved about it specificially was the drama and emotion it was able
to elicite from the crowd. Walking out of the movie everyone was silent and it was like they were
too stunned to speak. If you're looking for a dramatic, emotional, sciency thriller you would
love this movie.

<h3>All the Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p>This series of movies is definitely my most watched movies of all time. I am not sure which one 
has my personal record of most watches (although now that I think of it is may be the goblet of fire)
but I have definitely seen all of these movies multiple times over when I was younger. I would reccomend
this movies to anyone no matter the age and just thinking about the movies now makes me want to
stop doing this and watch one.</p>


<h3>Talented Mr. Ripley</h3>
<p>To be honest I don't even remember what this movie was about but I remember it as one of my favorite movies.
If I don't even remember what it was about and I like it it must be good.</p>
